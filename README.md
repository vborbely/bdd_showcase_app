# bdd_showcase_app

Showcasing a Flutter project widget testing with Goldens.

The project is using 2 pacakges:

1. eBay's Golden Toolkit
2. bdd_widget_test (_by Oleksandr Leushchenko_): this implements the well-known BDD(Gherkin) syntax for easy-to-use techniques. The testers will
   appreciate it very much.

The project is forked from [Oleksandr Leushchenko's GitHub repo](https://github.com/olexale/bdd_showcase_app). Many
thanks for him presenting the possibilities with golden_toolkit package.
